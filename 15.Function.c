/* A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

Predefined Functions
So it turns out you already know what a function is. You have been using it the whole time while studying this tutorial!

For example, main() is a function, which is used to execute code, and printf() is a function; used to output/print text to the screen:
*/

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
  return 0;
}


/* 	Create a Function
To create (often referred to as declare) your own function, specify the name of the function, followed by parentheses () and curly brackets {}:

	Syntax
void myFunction() {
  // code to be executed
}
	
	Example Explained
myFunction() is the name of the function
void means that the function does not have a return value. You will learn more about return values later in the next chapter
Inside the function (the body), add code that defines what the function should do
Call a Function
Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed when they are called.

To call a function, write the function's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon ;

In the following example, myFunction() is used to print a text (the action), when it is called:
*/

int main() {
  // Create a function
  void myFunction() {
    printf("I just got executed!");
  }

  int main() {
    myFunction(); // call the function
    return 0;
  }
// Outputs "I just got executed!"
  return 0;
}


// A function can be called multiple times:

int main() {
  void myFunction() {
    printf("I just got executed!");
  }

  int main() {
    myFunction();
    myFunction();
    myFunction();
    return 0;
  }
// I just got executed!
// I just got executed!
// I just got executed!
  return 0;
}
